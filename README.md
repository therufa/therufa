### Hi there 👋

I'm just an average Joe living a simple life as a [freelance|indie] developer, code person and so on, somewhere in the middle of nowhere.

In this current life I discovered that the passion of my host is to write software code, and therefore I fully support the life form in his endeavours. 👽🛸

I mainly work with javascript stuff lately, but there's much more under the hood. Thanks for checking in! 👋

This is just a reminder to myself
